Here's the why behind each.",

The editor reads and mutates a Deck. Export consumes a Deck. Share links store a Deck. There is no separate \"editor model\" that drifts from a \"render model.\"",
          "This sounds obvious, but it's the decision that keeps the codebase small. Because the shape is typed in one place, the compiler catches the moment a feature forgets a field. New capabilities — a new slide layout, a chart type, a per-slide variant — are added to the type once, and every surface that touches a deck is forced to acknowledge them.

          "The payoff is consistency you don't have to maintain. What you edit is exactly what you present and exactly what exports — because it's literally the same render path.
